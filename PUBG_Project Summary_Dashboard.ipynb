    "After analyzing the clustering labels, I was skeptical about the high number of hackers present in our dataset. Despite the minimal amount of information on the internet regarding hackers in PUBG, I was able to get a factual statistic of 1.5 million accounts that were banned for hacking and at the time there were 26 million accounts created worldwide [[2](https://gamerant.com/playerunknowns-battlegrounds-cheater-ban-count/)]. Using that statistic, I calculated 5.8% of the population were hackers. And with such a minuscule amount of hackers, I decided to reformulate the problem as anomaly detection or outlier detection.\n",

    "After analyzing all the clustering algorithms, I researched dimensional reduction techniques to aid in minimizing the misclassification when clustering. Some algorithms have difficulty when dealing with the large number of dimensions (features) and dimensional reduction techniques minimize the number of features while keeping the essential information. Also, it may aid in finding new feature combinations to cluster the data. Therefore, Prinicipal Components Analyiss was experimented with all the algorithms used previously. Two iterations of PCA were utilized: All features and selected features (Kill-Death Ratio, Headshot-Kill Ratio, Win Ratio, and Top 10 Ratio). \n",
